About Music:
</h3>
<p>
    Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive content.
    Exact definitions of music vary considerably around the world, though it is an aspect of all human societies, a cultural universal.
    While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions.
    The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance, though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. 
    Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice.
